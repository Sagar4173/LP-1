### Step-by-Step Algorithm of the Code:

1. **Class Definitions:**
   - **SymbolTable**: Stores labels and their corresponding addresses.
   - **LiteralTable**: Stores literals and their addresses, also manages literal pools.
   - **IntermediateCode**: Stores instructions along with their addresses and operands.

2. **AssemblerPass1 Initialization**:
   - Initializes `symbol_table`, `literal_table`, `intermediate_code`, and sets the `location_counter` to 0.
   - Defines the directives `START`, `END`, and `LTORG` and assigns respective methods to handle them.

3. **Directives**:
   - **START**: Sets the `location_counter` to the specified operand (starting address).
   - **END**: Allocates any unallocated literals in the literal table.
   - **LTORG**: Allocates literals in the literal table from the current `location_counter`.

4. **Processing Each Line**:
   - The `process_line()` method parses each line of source code into `label`, `instruction`, and `operand`.
   - If a label is present, it's added to the symbol table with the current `location_counter`.
   - If the instruction is a directive (e.g., `START`, `END`, `LTORG`), the appropriate directive handler is called.
   - If the instruction is not a directive, it's added to the intermediate code along with the operand, and the `location_counter` is incremented.
   - If an operand is a literal (i.e., starts with '='), it's added to the literal table.

5. **Assembly Process**:
   - The `assemble()` method processes each line of the source code, updating the symbol table, literal table, and intermediate code.
   - Finally, the symbol table, literal table, and intermediate code are returned.

6. **Output**:
   - Prints the contents of the symbol table, literal table (with literal pools), and intermediate code.

### Possible Questions and Their Answers:

1. **What is the purpose of the `SymbolTable` class?**
   - It stores labels and their corresponding addresses.

2. **What does the `LiteralTable` class do?**
   - It stores literals and their addresses and manages literal pools.

3. **What is the function of the `IntermediateCode` class?**
   - It stores instructions, along with their addresses and operands.

4. **What is the role of `AssemblerPass1` in the code?**
   - It processes source code, handling labels, directives, and instructions while updating tables.

5. **How does the `START` directive work?**
   - It sets the `location_counter` to the specified starting address.

6. **What happens when the `END` directive is encountered?**
   - It allocates any literals that haven't been allocated yet in the literal table.

7. **Explain the purpose of the `LTORG` directive.**
   - It allocates literals from the current `location_counter` in the literal table.

8. **What does the `process_line()` method do?**
   - It parses each line of the source code, identifies labels, instructions, and operands, and updates tables accordingly.

9. **What does the `add_symbol()` method in the `SymbolTable` class do?**
   - It adds a label to the symbol table with the current address if it's not already present.

10. **What does the `add_literal()` method in the `LiteralTable` class do?**
    - It adds a literal to the literal table if it hasn't been added already.

11. **How does the literal allocation work in `LiteralTable`?**
    - Literals are allocated an address starting from a specified `start_address`, and the `location_counter` is updated.

12. **Why is the `location_counter` used in the assembly process?**
    - It keeps track of the current address where the next instruction or literal will be placed.

13. **What is the significance of the `symbol_table` in the assembly process?**
    - It stores labels and their addresses to resolve labels during the assembly process.

14. **What does the `__str__` method in each class do?**
    - It provides a string representation of the object for easy printing and visualization.

15. **What happens if a literal is already present in the literal table?**
    - The literal is not added again to avoid duplicates.

16. **What does the `assemble()` method return?**
    - It returns the symbol table, literal table, and intermediate code after processing the source code.

17. **How does the code handle literals starting with '='?**
    - Literals starting with '=' are added to the literal table for later allocation.

18. **What is the final output of the program?**
    - The symbol table, literal table with pools, and intermediate code are printed.
