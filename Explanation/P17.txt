### Step-by-Step Algorithm

1. **Include Libraries**: 
   ```cpp
   #include <SD.h>
   #include "DHT.h"
   ```
   - The `SD.h` library is included but isn’t used in the code. The `DHT.h` library is used to read humidity and temperature data from the DHT11 sensor.

2. **Define Constants**: 
   ```cpp
   #define DHTPIN 4
   #define DHTTYPE DHT11
   ```
   - `DHTPIN` is set to 4, indicating that the DHT sensor is connected to Arduino pin 4.
   - `DHTTYPE` is set to `DHT11`, specifying the type of sensor being used.

3. **Create DHT Object**: 
   ```cpp
   DHT dht(DHTPIN, DHTTYPE);
   ```
   - Initializes an instance of the `DHT` class with the specified pin and sensor type. This object (`dht`) will be used to access the sensor’s functions.

4. **Setup Function**:
   ```cpp
   void setup() {
     Serial.begin(9600);
     Serial.println("Humidity AND Temperature");
     dht.begin();
   }
   ```
   - **Serial.begin(9600);**: Starts serial communication at a baud rate of 9600, enabling the Arduino to send data to the Serial Monitor.
   - **Serial.println("Humidity AND Temperature");**: Prints a header in the Serial Monitor to label the readings.
   - **dht.begin();**: Initializes the DHT sensor, setting it up for data reading.

5. **Loop Function**:
   ```cpp
   void loop() {
     delay(2000);
     float h = dht.readHumidity();
     float t = dht.readTemperature();
     Serial.print("\nHumidity:");
     Serial.print(h);
     Serial.print("\n% Temperature :");
     Serial.print(t);
     Serial.print("*C");
   }
   ```
   - **delay(2000);**: Adds a delay of 2 seconds to slow down the readings, so the data is displayed at 2-second intervals.
   - **float h = dht.readHumidity();**: Reads humidity from the DHT11 sensor and stores it in the variable `h`.
   - **float t = dht.readTemperature();**: Reads temperature in Celsius from the sensor and stores it in the variable `t`.
   - **Serial.print statements**: Sends the humidity and temperature values to the Serial Monitor with appropriate labels.

### Possible Questions and Answers

#### 1. **What is the purpose of including the `SD.h` library?**
   - **Answer**: The `SD.h` library is typically used for working with SD cards. However, in this code, it is not used, so it can be removed unless we plan to log data to an SD card.

#### 2. **Why do we include the `DHT.h` library, and what is its role?**
   - **Answer**: The `DHT.h` library allows us to communicate with DHT sensors, such as the DHT11. It provides functions to read temperature and humidity from the sensor.

#### 3. **Why is `DHTPIN` set to 4, and what does it represent?**
   - **Answer**: `DHTPIN` is set to 4 to define that the data pin of the DHT11 sensor is connected to pin 4 on the Arduino. This constant allows us to easily change the pin number if necessary.

#### 4. **What does `dht.begin()` do in the `setup()` function?**
   - **Answer**: `dht.begin()` initializes the DHT sensor, allowing it to start communicating and preparing it for data reading. It should be called once in the `setup()` function.

#### 5. **Why is there a `delay(2000);` in the `loop()` function?**
   - **Answer**: The `delay(2000);` pauses the loop for 2 seconds, creating a delay between readings. Without it, the data would be read and printed too quickly, making it difficult to view on the Serial Monitor.

#### 6. **What data type is used for the variables `h` and `t`, and why?**
   - **Answer**: The data type `float` is used for `h` (humidity) and `t` (temperature) because it allows us to store decimal values, which are needed to represent temperature and humidity measurements accurately.

#### 7. **What would happen if we used `int` instead of `float` for `h` and `t`?**
   - **Answer**: If `int` were used, the decimal values would be truncated, leading to inaccurate readings. For example, a temperature of `22.5°C` would be stored as `22`, losing the precision of the measurement.

#### 8. **How does `Serial.print()` work, and what does it do in this code?**
   - **Answer**: `Serial.print()` sends text or variable values to the Serial Monitor. In this code, it is used to display labels (e.g., `"Humidity:"`) and the actual sensor readings (`h` and `t`) on the Serial Monitor.

#### 9. **What would you do if the sensor readings returned `NaN` (Not a Number) instead of values?**
   - **Answer**: If readings return `NaN`, it means there’s an error in reading data. We can add error handling using `if (isnan(h) || isnan(t))` to check if the values are valid before printing them.

#### 10. **How would you modify this code to log data to an SD card?**
   - **Answer**: To log data to an SD card, we would need to initialize the SD card in the `setup()` function using `SD.begin()` and write to a file in the `loop()` function using commands like `File dataFile = SD.open("data.txt", FILE_WRITE);`. After logging, we would close the file with `dataFile.close();`.

#### 11. **Can you explain why `DHT dht(DHTPIN, DHTTYPE);` is necessary?**
   - **Answer**: `DHT dht(DHTPIN, DHTTYPE);` creates an object of the `DHT` class, which allows access to functions for reading temperature and humidity. It uses the specified pin (`DHTPIN`) and sensor type (`DHTTYPE`).

#### 12. **What would happen if you removed `dht.begin();`?**
   - **Answer**: If `dht.begin();` were removed, the DHT sensor would not initialize, and attempting to read data from it would likely result in incorrect or failed readings.

#### 13. **Why is the temperature unit represented as `*C` in the output?**
   - **Answer**: `*C` represents degrees Celsius, the unit of measurement for temperature. This is appended to the temperature value to make the output more understandable.

#### 14. **What are some potential issues when using the DHT11 sensor?**
   - **Answer**: Potential issues include:
      - **No response** if the sensor isn’t properly powered or connected.
      - **Inaccurate readings** if the sensor isn’t calibrated.
      - **High latency** due to a slower refresh rate, making it unsuitable for applications needing rapid updates.

#### 15. **How could this code be modified to display temperature in Fahrenheit?**
   - **Answer**: You can convert Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula `F = C * 9/5 + 32`. After reading temperature in Celsius (`t`), calculate `float f = t * 9.0 / 5.0 + 32;`, and then print `f` instead of `t`.
