4.Write a program to simulate page replacement  algorithm FIFO Here's a step-by-step algorithm for the FIFO page replacement code, followed by potential questions and answers:

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
1. **Initialize Queue and Page Fault Counter:**
   - Create an empty queue (`page_queue`) with a maximum length equal to the memory capacity.
   - Set a counter (`page_faults`) to zero for counting page faults.

2. **Process Each Page in the Reference String:**
   - For each page in `pages`:
     1. **Check Page Presence in Memory:**
        - If the page is not in `page_queue` (meaning itâ€™s not currently in memory):
          - Print a message indicating that the page is loaded into memory.
          - Add (append) the page to `page_queue`, which may remove the oldest page if `page_queue` has reached its capacity.
          - Increment the `page_faults` counter.
        - If the page is already in `page_queue`:
          - Print a message indicating that the page is already in memory, and no page fault occurs.

3. **Output Total Page Faults:**
   - After processing all pages, print the total number of page faults.

4. **Main Execution:**
   - Define a list of page references and a memory capacity, then call `fifo_page_replacement()` with these parameters to simulate the page replacement process.

### Potential Questions and Answers

1. **Q: What is FIFO page replacement?**  
   **A:** FIFO (First-In-First-Out) page replacement is an algorithm that removes the oldest page in memory when a new page needs to be loaded and the memory is full. The idea is to replace the page that has been in memory the longest.

2. **Q: Why do we use a deque with a maximum length in this code?**  
   **A:** A deque (double-ended queue) with a maximum length automatically removes the oldest element when a new one is added, making it suitable for FIFO, which discards the oldest page when memory is full.

3. **Q: What does a "page fault" mean in this context?**  
   **A:** A page fault occurs when a page needed by the program is not currently in memory, so it must be loaded, potentially replacing an existing page if memory is full.

4. **Q: Why is the `page_faults` variable initialized to zero?**  
   **A:** The `page_faults` variable counts the number of page faults that occur during the simulation. Initializing it to zero ensures an accurate count from the start.

5. **Q: What will happen if the capacity is set to a very high number?**  
   **A:** If the memory capacity is large enough to hold all pages in the reference list, no page faults will occur after the initial loads since all pages will fit in memory without replacement.

6. **Q: How does this algorithm handle the case where a page is already in memory?**  
   **A:** If a page is already in memory (in `page_queue`), the algorithm does not increment the page fault counter and simply prints that the page is already loaded. No replacement occurs.

7. **Q: Can this algorithm be used for a non-FIFO page replacement method?**  
   **A:** No, this specific code is tailored for FIFO. Other algorithms, like LRU or Optimal page replacement, require different data structures and logic to track page access order or future references.
