12.Design suitable data structures and implement Pass-II of a two pass assembler for pseudo-machine .Implementation should consist of a few instructions from each category and few assembler directives .The output of pass-I(Intermediate code file and symbol table)should be input for Pass-II

Here is a step-by-step algorithm for the Pass-II assembler code, followed by possible questions and answers:

### Step-by-Step Algorithm

1. **Initialize Symbol, Literal, and OpCode Tables:**
   - `SymbolTable` and `LiteralTable` classes store symbols and literals along with their addresses.
   - `OpCodeTable` class defines opcodes for machine instructions.

2. **Define the Pass-II Assembler Class:**
   - `PassTwoAssembler` is initialized with `intermediate_code` (a list of tuples containing location counter, opcode, and operand), `symbol_table`, and `literal_table`.
   - It also initializes an instance of `OpCodeTable` and an empty list `object_code` to store generated object code lines.

3. **Resolve Operand Address:**
   - Define the `resolve_operand` method to find the address for each operand:
     - First, check if the operand is a symbol using `symbol_table`.
     - If not found, check if it’s a literal using `literal_table`.
     - If the operand is numeric, return it directly.
     - If none of these checks succeed, return `None` to indicate an undefined operand.

4. **Generate Object Code:**
   - The `generate_object_code` method processes each line in `intermediate_code`:
     - For each `(loc_counter, opcode, operand)`:
       - Retrieve the hexadecimal opcode using `opcode_table`.
       - If the opcode isn’t found, raise an error.
       - Call `resolve_operand` to find the operand’s address.
       - If the operand is undefined, raise an error.
       - Format the object code in the format `location counter`, `opcode`, and `operand address`. If no operand is provided, use a placeholder like `000`.
       - Append the formatted line to `object_code`.

5. **Print Object Code:**
   - Define `print_object_code` to print each line in `object_code` as formatted machine code.

6. **Main Execution (Example Data):**
   - Define `intermediate_code` representing assembly instructions with location counters.
   - Populate `symbol_table` with symbols and addresses.
   - Create an instance of `PassTwoAssembler`, call `generate_object_code`, and print the results.

### Possible Questions and Answers

1. **Q: What is the purpose of a Pass-II assembler?**  
   **A:** A Pass-II assembler generates the final machine code by converting assembly language instructions into machine-readable format, resolving addresses of symbols and literals along the way.

2. **Q: What is the role of the `resolve_operand` function?**  
   **A:** `resolve_operand` finds the memory address of an operand. It checks the symbol and literal tables or returns the operand directly if it’s a numeric value.

3. **Q: Why is an `OpCodeTable` used?**  
   **A:** The `OpCodeTable` stores machine opcodes for each mnemonic, allowing quick translation of mnemonics into machine-readable hex codes.

4. **Q: What does `get_opcode` do in `OpCodeTable`?**  
   **A:** `get_opcode` retrieves the hex code for a given mnemonic. If the mnemonic isn’t recognized, it returns `None`.

5. **Q: How does the code handle undefined symbols or literals?**  
   **A:** If a symbol or literal is undefined, `resolve_operand` returns `None`, and `generate_object_code` raises an error to indicate the issue.

6. **Q: What is intermediate code?**  
   **A:** Intermediate code is a representation of assembly instructions, typically produced in the first pass of an assembler. It includes location counters, opcodes, and operands.

7. **Q: How does this assembler handle operands that don’t require an address?**  
   **A:** If an operand is not provided, `generate_object_code` appends `000` as a placeholder, ensuring all object code lines are formatted consistently.

8. **Q: Can this assembler be extended for more complex assembly instructions?**  
   **A:** Yes, by adding more entries to `OpCodeTable` and enhancing `resolve_operand` to handle additional operand types, the assembler can support more complex instructions.
