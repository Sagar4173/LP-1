### Step-by-Step Algorithm for the Next Fit Memory Allocation Code

---

### **1. Problem Overview**

The **Next Fit** algorithm is a variant of the First Fit algorithm. It starts looking for the next suitable memory block from where the previous allocation ended, rather than starting from the beginning each time.

---

### **2. Detailed Steps of the Algorithm**

#### **Step 1: Initialize Variables**
- **`allocation`**: An array of size `n` (number of processes), initialized to `-1`. It stores the block allocated to each process or `-1` if no block is assigned.
- **`j`**: Keeps track of the last allocated block, initialized to `0`.
- **`t`**: Tracks the stopping condition to avoid infinite loops.

#### **Step 2: Iterate Over Each Process**
- **Outer Loop (`for i in range(n)`):**
  - For each process `i`, find a block starting from the position `j` and wrap around if necessary.

#### **Step 3: Search for a Suitable Block**
- **Inner Loop (`while j < m`):**
  - If `blockSize[j] >= processSize[i]`:
    - Allocate the block: `allocation[i] = j`.
    - Reduce block size: `blockSize[j] -= processSize[i]`.
    - Update stopping point: `t = (j - 1) % m`.
    - Break from the loop after allocation.
  - If `t == j`, stop after checking all blocks.

- **Update `j`**:
  - Use `(j + 1) % m` to cycle through blocks in a circular manner.

#### **Step 4: Print Allocation Results**
- After the allocation loop, print a table displaying:
  - Process number.
  - Process size.
  - Allocated block number or "Not Allocated" if no suitable block was found.

### **Example Execution**

Given input:
```python
blockSize = [100, 500, 200, 300, 600]
processSize = [212, 417, 112, 426]
```

Output:
```plaintext
Process No. Process Size Block no.
         1         212         2
         2         417         5
         3         112         3
         4         426         Not Allocated
```

### **Explanation**:
1. **Process 1 (212)**: Allocated to **Block 2**.
2. **Process 2 (417)**: Next Fit continues from **Block 3**; allocated to **Block 5**.
3. **Process 3 (112)**: Allocated to **Block 3**.
4. **Process 4 (426)**: No block is large enough.

### Possible Questions and Answers

---

#### **1. What is the Next Fit Algorithm?**
- **Answer**: The Next Fit algorithm allocates a process to the first available memory block that fits, starting from where the last allocation left off. It wraps around when reaching the end of the block list.

---

#### **2. How Does Next Fit Work?**
- **Answer**:
  1. Start searching from the block after the last allocated one.
  2. If the end of the block list is reached, wrap around to the beginning.
  3. Allocate to the first block that fits or leave unallocated if no suitable block is found.

---

#### **3. What Is the Time Complexity of Next Fit?**
- **Answer**:
  - **Best Case**: \(O(n)\) (if suitable blocks are found quickly).
  - **Worst Case**: \(O(n \times m)\), where \(n\) is the number of processes, and \(m\) is the number of blocks.

---

#### **4. Why Use Circular Searching?**
- **Answer**: It prevents the need to always start from the first block and distributes allocations more evenly.

---

#### **5. What Is the Key Difference Between Next Fit and First Fit?**
- **Answer**:
  - **First Fit** always starts searching from the beginning.
  - **Next Fit** starts searching from the block after the last allocation, reducing repeated searches in already checked blocks.

---

#### **6. How Does Next Fit Handle Fragmentation?**
- **Answer**: 
  - **Internal Fragmentation**: Same as First Fit.
  - **External Fragmentation**: It may leave gaps similar to First Fit but avoids rechecking blocks repeatedly.

---

#### **7. Why Could a Process Be Left Unallocated?**
- **Answer**: A process is left unallocated if no block is large enough to accommodate it.

---

#### **8. How Is the Circular Behavior Achieved in This Code?**
- **Answer**: Using `j = (j + 1) % m`, the index `j` wraps around to the start of the block list when it exceeds `m-1`.

---

#### **9. What Are the Advantages of Next Fit?**
- **Answer**:
  - Faster allocation in some cases, as it avoids searching already-checked blocks.
  - Distributes processes more evenly across blocks.

---

#### **10. What Are the Drawbacks of Next Fit?**
- **Answer**:
  - Still susceptible to external fragmentation.
  - Could miss an earlier suitable block if memory is unevenly distributed.

---

#### **11. How Does the Algorithm Behave with Dynamic Block Sizes?**
- **Answer**: In a dynamic setting, blocks could grow or shrink as processes are allocated and deallocated, but Next Fit would still start searching from the last allocation point.
